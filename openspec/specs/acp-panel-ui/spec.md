# acp-panel-ui Specification

## Purpose
Renders an ACP agent session as a native chat-like panel — streaming
messages, tool calls, diffs, and permission prompts — as the default view
for ACP-managed agents, with an explicit toggle back to the raw terminal.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Panel is the default view for ACP-managed agents
When an agent's type has a registered ACP adapter and the agent is not
explicitly set to Terminal mode, the system SHALL show the panel view instead
of the terminal grid for that agent.

#### Scenario: Agent type has no ACP adapter
- **WHEN** an agent's type has no registered ACP adapter
- **THEN** the system SHALL show the terminal view for that agent and SHALL
  NOT offer the panel as a view mode

### Requirement: View-mode toggle
The system SHALL let the user switch a single agent between Panel and
Terminal view independently of other agents, and SHALL persist the last
chosen mode per agent. Switching modes SHALL NOT interrupt an in-flight ACP
turn or terminal process.

#### Scenario: Switch to Terminal mid-turn
- **WHEN** the user switches an agent from Panel to Terminal while a prompt
  turn is streaming
- **THEN** the turn continues running and its remaining updates are applied to
  panel state so switching back shows the complete conversation

### Requirement: Streaming message rendering
The system SHALL render assistant text as it streams (text deltas appended
to the current message, not replaced), and SHALL visually distinguish user
messages, assistant messages, system/tool content, and shell-command results
the user ran from the prompt input.

#### Scenario: Rapid successive text deltas
- **WHEN** the agent emits several text deltas for the same message in quick
  succession
- **THEN** the panel reflects the latest accumulated text without visible
  flicker or reordering

#### Scenario: A shell result reads as neither message nor tool call
- **WHEN** the conversation holds a user message, an assistant message, a
  tool call, and a shell-command result
- **THEN** each is visually distinct from the others, so the reader can tell
  the user ran the command rather than the agent

### Requirement: The conversation shows that a turn is in progress

While a turn is active the conversation SHALL show a turn-in-progress indicator
as its last row, below every message and below the permission prompt and
ended-session banner when either is present. The row SHALL appear when the turn
becomes active and SHALL be gone once the turn ends, so its presence is itself
the statement that the agent is still answering.

The indicator SHALL be an animated rendering of the application's own icon. It
SHALL NOT be the dashboard card's working indicator: that mark exists to
distinguish four agent states in a dense grid, and this row has one thing to
say. This diverges from the Swift reference, whose panel has no indicator of
this kind at all.

The animation SHALL be continuous while the turn is active — it SHALL NOT stop
on a frame, run once, or wait for unrelated activity to advance it. A reader
watching a turn that produces no output for several seconds SHALL still see
motion.

The indicator SHALL respect the system's reduced-motion setting: when reduced
motion is in effect the row SHALL still be present and SHALL still show the
icon, held still rather than animating. Presence, not motion, is what carries
the meaning in that case.

The indicator SHALL carry no text. It SHALL be drawn large enough to read as a
deliberate mark rather than as a stray glyph, and SHALL reserve the same space
whether it is animating or held still, so the conversation does not reflow when
the setting changes.

#### Scenario: A turn is running

- **WHEN** an agent's turn is active
- **THEN** the conversation's last row shows the animated application icon

#### Scenario: The turn ends

- **WHEN** the agent's turn ends
- **THEN** the indicator row is gone and the rows above it are unchanged

#### Scenario: A quiet turn still shows motion

- **WHEN** a turn is active and the agent has produced no output for several
  seconds
- **THEN** the indicator is still animating

#### Scenario: The indicator sits below a permission prompt

- **WHEN** a turn is active and a permission request is awaiting a decision
- **THEN** the permission prompt is rendered above the indicator row

#### Scenario: Reduced motion is in effect

- **WHEN** the system's reduced-motion setting is on and a turn is active
- **THEN** the indicator row is present and shows the icon without animating

#### Scenario: The conversation does not reflow when motion is disabled

- **WHEN** the indicator is shown animating and then shown held still
- **THEN** it occupies the same space in both cases

### Requirement: Rendered Markdown separates body from headers by font

Every Markdown surface — the panel's assistant messages and the Markdown pane
opened for an agent — SHALL draw body text in the configured UI font and
headers (`#` through `######`) in the configured title font.

Body text is everything but a header: paragraphs, list items, table cells,
block quotes, link text, and the text around inline code. Inline code and code
blocks SHALL keep the monospace family, as elsewhere in the panel.

A header SHALL keep the size and weight its level already gives it, so the two
faces are the change and the heading hierarchy is not.

Inline formatting inside a header — bold, italics, a link, inline code — SHALL
render as plain text in the title font. The renderer draws a header from its
text rather than its inline marks, and a header carrying a mark SHALL render as
the words themselves rather than as the Markdown source that marked them: `##
A **bold** word` renders as "A bold word", with no asterisks shown and no bold
run.

Changing either font in settings SHALL change the corresponding Markdown text
without reopening the surface.

#### Scenario: A response with a header and a paragraph

- **WHEN** an agent's response contains a `##` header followed by a paragraph
- **THEN** the header is drawn in the title font and the paragraph in the UI
  font

#### Scenario: Body constructs stay in the UI font

- **WHEN** a response contains a list, a table and a block quote
- **THEN** each is drawn in the UI font, and none of them in the title font

#### Scenario: Code keeps its own family

- **WHEN** a response contains a fenced code block and an inline code span
- **THEN** both are drawn in the monospace family, and the words around the
  inline span are drawn in the UI font

#### Scenario: A header keeps its level's size and weight

- **WHEN** a response contains an `#` header and a `###` header
- **THEN** both are drawn in the title font, at the sizes and weights their
  levels had before the two faces were split

#### Scenario: A header containing a mark

- **WHEN** a response contains the header `## A **bold** word`
- **THEN** the header line reads "A bold word" in the title font, with no
  asterisks and no bold run

#### Scenario: The Markdown pane follows the same split

- **WHEN** a Markdown file shown for an agent contains headers and paragraphs
- **THEN** its headers are drawn in the title font and its body in the UI font

#### Scenario: Changing the UI font redraws body text

- **WHEN** the user picks a new UI font family while a response with headers
  and paragraphs is on screen
- **THEN** the body text is redrawn in the new family and the headers are
  unchanged

### Requirement: A rendered code block carries a copy control

Every code block drawn on a Markdown surface — the panel's assistant messages
and the Markdown pane opened for an agent — SHALL carry a copy control in the
block's upper-right corner, inside the block's own background.

Activating it SHALL place that block's code on the system clipboard and SHALL
confirm with a transient notification, in the same style the panel's existing
copy actions use. The text placed on the clipboard SHALL be the code as
written inside the block: no fence markers, no language tag, and nothing from
the surrounding prose.

The control SHALL be present whenever the block is on screen, not only while
the pointer is over it, and SHALL carry a localized tooltip naming what it
copies. Its tooltip and its confirmation SHALL both be resolved through
localization rather than carried as literal English in the renderer.

Inline code spans SHALL NOT carry a copy control: only block-level code does.

The control SHALL NOT change how the code itself is drawn — same monospace
family, same block background, same wrapping — and SHALL NOT replace or
disturb the response action bar's existing "copy response", which continues to
copy the whole response.

This diverges from the Swift app, which renders a code block as plain
preformatted text in a web view with no copy affordance of any kind.

#### Scenario: Copying one block's code

- **WHEN** a response contains a fenced code block and the user activates that
  block's copy control
- **THEN** the system clipboard holds exactly the lines inside the fence, with
  neither the fence markers nor the language tag, and a confirmation
  notification is shown

#### Scenario: Several code blocks in one response

- **WHEN** a response contains three code blocks and the user activates the
  second block's copy control
- **THEN** the clipboard holds the second block's code alone, and the other two
  blocks' contents are not included

#### Scenario: The Markdown pane carries the same control

- **WHEN** a Markdown file shown for an agent contains a code block
- **THEN** that block carries the same copy control in the same corner, with
  the same copied text, as a code block in an assistant message

#### Scenario: Inline code is left alone

- **WHEN** a response contains an inline code span in the middle of a sentence
- **THEN** no copy control is drawn for that span

#### Scenario: The control does not wait for a hover

- **WHEN** a code block is on screen and the pointer is elsewhere
- **THEN** the block's copy control is still drawn in its upper-right corner

#### Scenario: Copying a response is unaffected

- **WHEN** a response containing a code block is finished and the user
  activates "copy response" on its action bar
- **THEN** the clipboard holds the full response text, code block and prose
  alike, exactly as it did before code blocks carried their own control

### Requirement: Prompt cell copy control

Each user message in the panel SHALL expose a copy control that places the
message's text on the system clipboard. The control SHALL be revealed on
hover of the message and SHALL copy exactly the prompt text, without the
bubble's surrounding chrome and without any attached-context payload.

The hover target SHALL be the prompt and its control together, as one region.
The control sits beside the bubble rather than inside it, so a target limited to
the bubble would hide the control at the moment the pointer reached it; moving
the pointer from the bubble onto the control SHALL keep it shown, and it SHALL
stay shown for as long as the pointer rests on it.

The hover target SHALL NOT extend beyond that region. A user message is
right-aligned within a full-width row, and pointing at the empty space beside it
SHALL reveal nothing.

Revealing and hiding the control SHALL NOT move anything on screen. Its space
SHALL be reserved whether it is shown or not, so a pointer travelling down a
conversation does not make the messages shift as it passes them.

The control SHALL NOT be drawn for anything but a user message, and hovering one
user message SHALL reveal only that message's control.

#### Scenario: Copying a prompt
- **WHEN** the user activates the copy control on a user message while
  hovering it
- **THEN** the message's text is placed on the system clipboard

#### Scenario: Attachments are not part of the copy
- **WHEN** the user copies a prompt that had files or images attached when it
  was sent
- **THEN** the clipboard receives the prompt text alone, with none of the
  attachment payload

#### Scenario: The control is not persistent chrome
- **WHEN** the pointer leaves the user message
- **THEN** the copy control is no longer shown, and the bubble itself is
  unchanged

#### Scenario: The control survives being pointed at
- **WHEN** the pointer moves from a user message's bubble onto the revealed copy
  control
- **THEN** the control stays shown and can be activated

#### Scenario: Empty space beside a prompt reveals nothing
- **WHEN** the pointer rests in the empty area to the left of a right-aligned
  user message, on the same line
- **THEN** no copy control is shown

#### Scenario: Hovering does not move the conversation
- **WHEN** the pointer moves down a conversation across several user messages
- **THEN** each control appears and disappears in place, and no message, bubble
  or surrounding content shifts position

#### Scenario: Only the hovered message reveals its control
- **WHEN** a conversation holds several user messages and the pointer rests on
  one of them
- **THEN** only that message's copy control is shown

### Requirement: Tool-call rendering
The system SHALL render each tool call as a distinct card showing its kind,
input summary, and result (or in-progress state) once received, and SHALL
render a file-edit tool call's diff as an added/removed line view rather than
raw text. This is the default presentation.

When the compact tool-call preference is enabled, contiguous tool-call
activity SHALL instead render as one updating summary line reporting the
call count and whichever file or command counts the tool metadata supports.
Tool execution results SHALL remain available in panel state either way and
SHALL NOT be discarded by compact rendering.

#### Scenario: Default individual rendering
- **WHEN** compact mode is disabled and a tool call completes
- **THEN** the panel renders that call as its own card with its result

#### Scenario: Compact rendering
- **WHEN** compact mode is enabled and a sequence of tool calls runs
- **THEN** the panel renders one updating summary line for the sequence

#### Scenario: Failed call remains represented
- **WHEN** a tool call fails in compact mode
- **THEN** the summary reflects the failed call and its failure remains
  inspectable in panel state

#### Scenario: Tool call fails
- **WHEN** a tool call's result reports an error
- **THEN** the card SHALL indicate failure and show the error content instead
  of a normal result

### Requirement: Permission prompts
The system SHALL render a pending permission request inline in the
conversation with its available options as actionable controls, SHALL block
sending further prompts for that session until the request is answered, and
SHALL send the user's choice back through the ACP client.

The prompt SHALL identify the tool call by a human-readable name rather than
its opaque id when one is known: the title carried by the request if present,
else the title of the panel's known tool-call card for that id, else the
call's kind. If none of these is known, the raw id SHALL be shown rather than
a blank.

#### Scenario: User denies a permission request
- **WHEN** the user selects a deny option on a permission request
- **THEN** the system sends that decision to the agent and the prompt is
  replaced with its resolved state (not left pending)

#### Scenario: The prompt names the tool
- **WHEN** a permission request arrives for a tool call the panel knows by
  the title "Reading configuration file"
- **THEN** the prompt reads "Permission requested for Reading configuration
  file" (or equivalent), not the call's opaque id

#### Scenario: An unnamed call falls back to its id
- **WHEN** a permission request carries no title and no matching card is
  known
- **THEN** the prompt shows the call's id rather than an empty name

### Requirement: Terminal remains available
The system SHALL NOT remove or degrade the existing terminal view. Any agent
— ACP-managed or not — SHALL be able to open a real terminal for that
agent's working directory, independent of ACP session state.

#### Scenario: Panel-mode agent opens a terminal
- **WHEN** the user opens a terminal for an agent currently in Panel mode
- **THEN** the system spawns a plain shell in that agent's working directory,
  independent of and without disturbing its ACP session

### Requirement: Tool call icon
Each tool call rendered in the message list SHALL display an icon
identifying the tool, positioned before the tool call's name/summary text.
An unrecognized tool name SHALL fall back to a generic tool icon rather
than omitting the icon.

#### Scenario: Known tool renders with its icon
- **WHEN** an agent response includes a call to a recognized tool (e.g. a
  file read or a shell command)
- **THEN** the panel renders that tool call with the icon mapped to that
  tool, immediately preceding its label

#### Scenario: Unknown tool falls back to generic icon
- **WHEN** an agent response includes a call to a tool the panel has no
  specific icon for
- **THEN** the panel renders that tool call with a generic fallback icon

### Requirement: A tool call's header separates content from chrome by font

A tool call card's title - the command it ran, the path it read, whatever the
agent named the call - SHALL render in the theme's monospace family. It is a
command, a path or an identifier, and the project renders those monospace
everywhere else.

The call's status SHALL be expressed by a status icon, and the card's own
words about the call - the status word shown in the icon's tooltip - SHALL be
in the proportional family.

#### Scenario: A shell command reads as a command

- **WHEN** a tool call titled `git status --porcelain=v2` renders
- **THEN** its title is in the monospace family

#### Scenario: The status stays prose

- **WHEN** a completed tool call renders with the status word "Done" as the
  status icon's tooltip
- **THEN** that word is in the proportional family, beside a monospace title

### Requirement: A tool call's outline says what state it is in

A tool call card's outline SHALL be coloured by its status:

- **failed**: the theme's danger colour.
- **in progress** (pending or running): the theme's info colour.
- **completed**: the same neutral border every other card in the panel uses.

A completed call SHALL NOT be given a colour of its own. Success is the
common case, and a conversation whose every finished call is outlined in
green is one where nothing stands out - which defeats the outline's only
purpose, marking the two states worth looking at.

Colours SHALL come from the theme rather than fixed values, so the card
follows a theme change like the rest of the panel.

#### Scenario: A failed call is marked

- **WHEN** a tool call reaches `failed`
- **THEN** its outline is the theme's danger colour

#### Scenario: A running call is marked

- **WHEN** a tool call is `pending` or `in_progress`
- **THEN** its outline is the theme's info colour

#### Scenario: A completed call recedes

- **WHEN** a tool call reaches `completed`
- **THEN** its outline is the panel's neutral card border, the same as an
  untouched card

#### Scenario: A call's outline follows it through its lifecycle

- **WHEN** a call starts, runs and then completes
- **THEN** its outline is the info colour while it runs and the neutral
  border once it is done, without the card being rebuilt around it

### Requirement: Tool call status icon

The system SHALL render a tool call's status as an icon whose glyph and color
follow the call's state: an in-flight state (pending or running) SHALL use the
theme's info colour, a failed call the theme's danger colour, and a completed
call the same neutral muted treatment as the card's finished state. The word
for the status SHALL be carried by the icon's tooltip.

#### Scenario: A running call reads as running

- **WHEN** a tool call is `pending` or `in_progress`
- **THEN** its status icon renders in the theme's info colour and its tooltip
  says "Pending" or "Running…" as appropriate

#### Scenario: A failed call is marked

- **WHEN** a tool call reaches `failed`
- **THEN** its status icon renders in the theme's danger colour and its
  tooltip says "Failed"

#### Scenario: A completed call recedes

- **WHEN** a tool call reaches `completed`
- **THEN** its status icon renders in the neutral muted style and its tooltip
  says "Done"

#### Scenario: An unrecognized status keeps its text

- **WHEN** a tool call reports a status the panel does not recognize
- **THEN** the card shows the raw status string rather than a fabricated icon,
  matching the panel's existing pass-through behavior for unknown statuses

### Requirement: Response action bar
Each completed agent response SHALL display an action bar with: copy
response, reply to the response, scroll to the user message that produced
this response, and scroll to the top of the conversation history.

Reply SHALL quote the response into the prompt input as a Markdown block
quote - every line prefixed with `>`, blank lines as a bare `>` - followed by
a blank line, so text typed after it starts a new paragraph rather than
continuing the quote. A draft already in the input SHALL be kept, with the
quote appended a paragraph below it. The input SHALL take focus with the
caret at the end, on the line below the quote.

#### Scenario: Copy response
- **WHEN** the user activates "copy response" on an agent response
- **THEN** the full text of that response is placed on the system
  clipboard

#### Scenario: Reply to a response
- **WHEN** the user activates "reply" on an agent response and then types
- **THEN** the prompt input holds the response as a block quote, and what
  the user typed follows it on its own line, outside the quote

#### Scenario: Reply keeps a draft
- **WHEN** the prompt input already holds a draft and the user activates
  "reply" on an agent response
- **THEN** the draft is unchanged and the quote follows it a paragraph below

#### Scenario: Scroll to originating user message
- **WHEN** the user activates "scroll to user input" on an agent response
- **THEN** the panel scrolls the history so the user message that
  prompted this response is visible

#### Scenario: Scroll to top
- **WHEN** the user activates "scroll to top" on an agent response
- **THEN** the panel scrolls the history to its earliest message

### Requirement: Track response toggle

The response still being streamed SHALL carry a track toggle in place of the
response action bar, and SHALL show the action bar instead once its turn
ends. The two SHALL NOT appear together: tracking only means something while
output is still arriving, and the action bar's items - copy, jump to the
prompt, jump to the top - only mean something once there is a finished
response to act on.

While the toggle is enabled for a given response, the panel's virtualized
list SHALL keep following the streamed output for that response,
auto-scrolling so the newest output stays visible. Manually scrolling the
history away from the tail SHALL disable following. Disabling the toggle
SHALL stop following even while the list is at the tail, so following is only
ever resumed by enabling the toggle or jumping to latest.

#### Scenario: The toggle gives way to the action bar

- **WHEN** the last response is still streaming
- **THEN** it shows the track toggle and not the response action bar
- **WHEN** that turn ends
- **THEN** it shows the response action bar and not the track toggle

#### Scenario: An earlier response never shows the toggle

- **WHEN** a response that is not the last one is rendered
- **THEN** it shows the response action bar, whether or not a later turn is
  active

#### Scenario: Tracking follows streamed output

- **WHEN** the user enables the track toggle on an in-progress response and
  the panel is following the tail
- **THEN** the list stays at the end and the newest streamed output is
  visible as it arrives

#### Scenario: Manual scroll disables tracking

- **WHEN** the user enables the track toggle on an in-progress response and
  then scrolls the history away from the tail
- **THEN** the list stops auto-scrolling, so the content the user scrolled to
  stays put as further output streams

#### Scenario: Turning the toggle off stops following even at the tail

- **WHEN** the user disables the track toggle on an in-progress response
- **THEN** the list stops auto-scrolling and stays where it is as further
  output streams, even if it is at the tail, rather than snapping back to the
  end

### Requirement: Input area context attachment
The input area SHALL provide an add-context control that lets the user
attach files or images to the next message.

Attached context SHALL have two presences, not one: an entry in the strip
above the input carrying its name and, for an image, its thumbnail; and a
styled reference at the caret in the buffer, giving the attachment a position
in the prompt. The two SHALL stay in step — removing either one removes the
attachment.

This holds however the context arrived: the add-context control, a drag from
the Finder, or a pasted image. This diverges from the Swift reference, whose
attachments appear only in the strip and have no position in the text.

#### Scenario: Attach a file
- **WHEN** the user activates the add-context control and selects a file
- **THEN** the file is attached to the pending message and shown in the
  input area before send

#### Scenario: An attachment has a place in the text
- **WHEN** the user attaches a file with the caret mid-sentence
- **THEN** a styled reference to it appears at the caret and its entry appears
  in the strip above the input

#### Scenario: Removing the strip entry removes the reference
- **WHEN** the user removes an attachment's entry from the strip
- **THEN** its reference is gone from the buffer and the attachment is not
  sent

#### Scenario: Deleting the reference removes the strip entry
- **WHEN** the user deletes an attachment's reference from the buffer
- **THEN** its entry is gone from the strip and the attachment is not sent

### Requirement: Input area permission mode selector
The input area SHALL provide a selector for the agent's permission mode,
applied to the next message and subsequent turns until changed.

The system SHALL locate the agent's permission-mode option without
requiring the agent to have categorized it. A declared option SHALL be
matched on its category when it carries one, and otherwise on its
identifier or name. Where several options match, the one the agent listed
first SHALL win. An option the system cannot render as a picker SHALL be
ignored.

#### Scenario: Change permission mode
- **WHEN** the user selects a different permission mode from the selector
- **THEN** subsequent agent turns run under the newly selected permission
  mode

#### Scenario: Uncategorized option still populates the selector
- **WHEN** the agent declares a selectable permission-mode option but
  attaches no category to it
- **THEN** the selector is populated from that option, rather than showing
  the "doesn't report permission modes" empty state

#### Scenario: Unknown category falls back to the option's own names
- **WHEN** the agent declares a selectable permission-mode option under a
  category the system does not recognize
- **THEN** the option is still matched by its identifier or name, and the
  selector is populated from it

#### Scenario: The agent's ordering breaks a tie
- **WHEN** more than one declared option matches the permission-mode
  selector
- **THEN** the selector uses the one the agent listed first

#### Scenario: No matching option shows the empty state
- **WHEN** the agent declares no option matching the permission-mode
  selector by category, identifier or name
- **THEN** the selector shows its "doesn't report permission modes" empty
  state, as before

### Requirement: Input area model selector
The input area SHALL provide a selector for which model the agent uses,
applied starting with the next message.

The system SHALL locate the agent's model option under the same matching
rule as the permission-mode selector: category first, then identifier or
name, ties broken by the agent's ordering, unrenderable options ignored.

#### Scenario: Change model
- **WHEN** the user selects a different model from the selector
- **THEN** the next message is sent using the newly selected model

#### Scenario: Uncategorized option still populates the selector
- **WHEN** the agent declares a selectable model option but attaches no
  category to it
- **THEN** the selector is populated from that option, rather than showing
  the "doesn't report selectable models" empty state

### Requirement: Input area effort selector
The input area SHALL provide a selector for the agent's reasoning effort
level, applied starting with the next message.

The system SHALL locate the agent's effort option under the same matching
rule as the permission-mode selector, and SHALL recognize the protocol's
own category for reasoning level in addition to the identifier spellings
it already accepts.

#### Scenario: Change effort level
- **WHEN** the user selects a different effort level from the selector
- **THEN** the next message is sent using the newly selected effort level

#### Scenario: The protocol's reasoning category is recognized
- **WHEN** the agent declares its reasoning-level option under the
  protocol's standard category for that concept
- **THEN** the effort selector is populated from that option

#### Scenario: Uncategorized option still populates the selector
- **WHEN** the agent declares a selectable effort option but attaches no
  category to it
- **THEN** the selector is populated from that option, rather than showing
  the "doesn't report selectable effort levels" empty state

### Requirement: Input area send control

The input area SHALL provide a send control that submits the pending message
(with any attached context) to the agent. The control SHALL be disabled while
the input is empty and while a permission request is pending. While a
response is in progress, activating the control SHALL enqueue the message for
delivery when the current turn ends; it SHALL NOT discard the message and
SHALL NOT be disabled on that account. While a response is in progress, the
input area SHALL also provide a stop control that interrupts the active ACP
turn for the selected session.

A pending message recognised as a shell command SHALL be exempt from these
rules: the control SHALL remain enabled for it while a permission request is
pending and while a response is in progress, and activating it SHALL run the
command rather than send or enqueue a message. The stop control SHALL keep
interrupting only the ACP turn; it SHALL NOT terminate a running shell
command.

#### Scenario: Send a message
- **WHEN** the user activates send with non-empty input and no response is in
  progress
- **THEN** the message and any attached context are submitted to the agent
  and the input area clears

#### Scenario: Send during a response enqueues
- **WHEN** the user activates send with non-empty input while a response is
  in progress
- **THEN** the message joins the prompt queue, the input area clears, and the
  message is delivered when the current turn ends

#### Scenario: A shell command sends during a response
- **WHEN** the user activates send on a shell command while a response is in
  progress
- **THEN** the command runs immediately, the input area clears, and the
  prompt queue is unchanged

#### Scenario: A shell command sends while permission is pending
- **WHEN** a permission request is pending and the input holds a shell
  command
- **THEN** the send control is enabled and activating it runs the command

#### Scenario: Stop an active turn
- **WHEN** the user activates stop while an ACP turn is in progress
- **THEN** the selected session receives a cancellation request and the
  control remains safe to activate again until the turn reaches a terminal
  state

#### Scenario: Stop leaves a running command alone
- **WHEN** the user activates stop while both an ACP turn and a shell command
  are running
- **THEN** the turn is cancelled and the shell command continues

#### Scenario: Cancellation completes
- **WHEN** the active turn is cancelled or finishes after a stop request
- **THEN** the stop control disappears, the input area returns to its normal
  state, and no later turn is cancelled

#### Scenario: Stop is scoped to one session
- **WHEN** the user stops work in one panel while another panel is active
- **THEN** only the selected panel's ACP turn is interrupted

### Requirement: Prompt queue
The system SHALL queue prompts delivered during a response and deliver them to
the agent in the order they were enqueued, one turn at a time, until the queue
empties. A queued prompt SHALL be visible in the conversation, clearly marked
as waiting until it is delivered, and SHALL read as a normal prompt once
delivered. Delivery SHALL resume on each turn end; a prompt whose delivery
fails SHALL be reported under that prompt, and the queue SHALL continue with
the remaining prompts.

#### Scenario: Prompts are delivered in order
- **WHEN** the user enqueues "first" and then "second" while a response is in
  progress
- **THEN** "first" is delivered when the current turn ends and "second" is
  delivered when the turn "first" started has ended

#### Scenario: A queued prompt is marked until delivered
- **WHEN** a prompt is enqueued during a response
- **THEN** the conversation shows it as waiting, and once its turn starts the
  same message reads as a delivered prompt

#### Scenario: A failed queued delivery continues the queue
- **WHEN** a queued prompt's delivery fails
- **THEN** the failure is reported under that prompt, the turn ends, and the
  next queued prompt is delivered

#### Scenario: A clean queue delivers immediately
- **WHEN** the user sends while no prompt is queued and no response is in
  progress
- **THEN** the prompt is delivered immediately and no queue entry is created

### Requirement: Permission gate is independent of the queue
Queued delivery SHALL NOT bypass a pending permission request: a prompt must
not be delivered while a permission request is awaiting an answer, whether or
not it was enqueued, and the send control remains disabled while a permission
request is pending.

#### Scenario: A permission request holds the queue
- **WHEN** a permission request is pending and the queue holds prompts
- **THEN** no queued prompt is delivered until the permission request is
  answered, after which delivery resumes

### Requirement: Input area expand and collapse
The input area SHALL provide an expand control that grows the input into
a larger multi-line editor, and collapses it back to its default size
when activated again.

#### Scenario: Expand input area
- **WHEN** the user activates the expand control on the default-size
  input area
- **THEN** the input area grows to a larger multi-line editing size

#### Scenario: Collapse input area
- **WHEN** the user activates the expand control on the expanded input
  area
- **THEN** the input area returns to its default size

### Requirement: Selecting a Panel-mode agent focuses its prompt input

When a Panel-mode agent becomes a workspace window's selected agent and its
conversation is what the content area shows, that agent's prompt input SHALL
receive keyboard focus. The user SHALL be able to select an agent and begin
typing a message with no intervening click.

This SHALL hold however the selection was made: clicking the agent's sidebar
row, clicking its card in the window's overview, creating the agent, or the
window opening on a restored selection. This diverges from the Swift reference,
which leaves focus wherever it was.

Focus SHALL be taken once per selection, not held. Once the user moves focus
elsewhere in the window, it SHALL stay where they put it until the selection
changes again — a window SHALL NOT pull focus back into the composer while the
user is working somewhere else in it.

Focus SHALL NOT be taken when the composer is not what the content area shows.
That covers the window showing its dashboard rather than an agent, and a
deactivated agent whose pane shows the stopped placeholder. In each of those
cases focus SHALL be left where it is. A Terminal-mode agent focuses its
terminal surface instead, under `terminal-input`'s "Selecting a Terminal-mode
agent focuses its terminal surface"; no composer is focused for it.

An open artifact panel SHALL withhold focus only while it is expanded. Under
`artifact-panel` an expanded panel takes the whole content area and the composer
is not on screen, which is the case this exception is for. An unexpanded panel
is a sibling of the content pane, so the composer is on screen beside a shown
markdown file or diagram and SHALL be focused as it is for any other selected
Panel-mode agent. Merely having an artifact open is not the condition.

Expanding or collapsing the panel SHALL NOT itself take focus. The panel's
expanded state decides whether focus can be taken for a selection, not whether
a new selection has happened; a panel returning to its set width makes the
composer visible again and SHALL leave focus wherever the user last put it,
under the once-per-selection rule above. The state read SHALL be the panel's
live expanded state, which the user's own toggle changes, and not the
`maximized` argument last recorded for the agent — the two differ from the
moment the user collapses a panel an agent maximized.

Focus SHALL NOT be taken from a modal dialog while one is open.

Taking focus SHALL NOT raise, activate or reorder any window. It places focus
within a window; which window the system considers frontmost is unaffected.

Each agent's composer keeps its own contents, so returning to an agent SHALL
focus that agent's composer with the text the user last left in it, caret
placement included where the composer already preserves it.

#### Scenario: Selecting an agent and typing

- **WHEN** the user clicks a Panel-mode agent's sidebar row and types
- **THEN** the typed text goes into that agent's prompt input, with no click on
  the composer

#### Scenario: A window opens on a restored selection

- **WHEN** a workspace window opens with a Panel-mode agent as its restored
  selection and its conversation on screen
- **THEN** that agent's prompt input has keyboard focus

#### Scenario: A newly created agent is ready to be prompted

- **WHEN** the user creates a Panel-mode agent and the window selects it
- **THEN** its prompt input has keyboard focus

#### Scenario: Focus is not pulled back

- **WHEN** the user selects a Panel-mode agent, then clicks a control elsewhere
  in the window, and the window redraws several times
- **THEN** focus stays on the control the user clicked

#### Scenario: Returning to an agent refocuses its own composer

- **WHEN** the user types a partial message to one agent, selects a second
  agent, and then selects the first again
- **THEN** the first agent's prompt input has focus and still holds the partial
  message

#### Scenario: A Terminal-mode agent does not move focus

- **WHEN** the user selects an agent that runs in Terminal mode
- **THEN** no prompt input is focused
- **AND** that agent's terminal surface takes focus instead, per
  `terminal-input`'s "Selecting a Terminal-mode agent focuses its terminal
  surface"

#### Scenario: The dashboard is showing

- **WHEN** the window is showing its dashboard rather than an agent's
  conversation
- **THEN** no prompt input is focused

#### Scenario: A markdown pane holds the content area

- **WHEN** the user selects a Panel-mode agent whose artifact panel is expanded,
  so the panel holds the content area and the composer is not on screen
- **THEN** focus is left where it was

#### Scenario: An unexpanded artifact panel does not withhold focus

- **WHEN** the user selects a Panel-mode agent that has a markdown file open in
  an unexpanded panel, beside its conversation
- **THEN** that agent's prompt input has keyboard focus

#### Scenario: Collapsing an expanded panel does not pull focus

- **WHEN** the user selects a Panel-mode agent whose panel is expanded, clicks a
  control elsewhere in the window, and then collapses the panel
- **THEN** focus stays on the control the user clicked, and the composer is
  shown without being focused

#### Scenario: A deactivated agent is selected

- **WHEN** the user selects a Panel-mode agent that is deactivated, so its pane
  shows the stopped placeholder
- **THEN** focus is left where it was

#### Scenario: A dialog keeps focus

- **WHEN** a modal dialog is open and the window's selection changes beneath it
- **THEN** the dialog keeps focus

### Requirement: A finished tool call collapses to its header

A tool call that has completed successfully SHALL render collapsed: its
header - icon, title and status - stays visible and its output is hidden.

A tool call that is still running SHALL stay expanded, since its output is
what the user is waiting on.

A tool call that failed SHALL stay expanded. Failure output is the reason the
user is reading the conversation at all, and hiding it behind a control makes
the one card that matters the one card they have to open.

Collapsing SHALL NOT discard anything: the content is hidden, not dropped,
and opening the card again shows exactly what was there.

#### Scenario: A call collapses when it succeeds

- **WHEN** a tool call the panel is showing expanded reaches `completed`
- **THEN** its output is hidden and its header remains, naming the tool and
  its status

#### Scenario: A running call stays open

- **WHEN** a tool call is `pending` or `in_progress`
- **THEN** it renders expanded

#### Scenario: A failed call stays open

- **WHEN** a tool call reaches `failed`
- **THEN** it renders expanded, with its output visible

#### Scenario: Reopening shows the same content

- **WHEN** the user opens a collapsed call
- **THEN** the output shown is the content that call finished with

### Requirement: Every tool call can be opened and closed

Each tool call card SHALL carry a control that toggles it between collapsed
and expanded, and that shows which of the two it currently is.

The control SHALL be present whatever the call's status - a running call can
be collapsed, a failed one can be closed - so the automatic behaviour above
is a default rather than a rule the user cannot escape.

#### Scenario: Closing a call the panel opened

- **WHEN** the user activates the control on an expanded call
- **THEN** that call collapses to its header

#### Scenario: Opening a call the panel closed

- **WHEN** the user activates the control on a collapsed call
- **THEN** that call expands and its output is shown

#### Scenario: A running call can be closed

- **WHEN** the user activates the control on an `in_progress` call
- **THEN** it collapses, and goes on streaming its output out of sight

### Requirement: The user's choice outlives the automatic one

Once the user has opened or closed a particular tool call, that choice SHALL
hold for that call for the rest of the session, including across the call
finishing. The automatic collapse SHALL apply only to a call the user has not
touched.

#### Scenario: A call opened while running stays open when it finishes

- **WHEN** the user opens a running call and it then reaches `completed`
- **THEN** it stays expanded

#### Scenario: A call closed while running stays closed when it finishes

- **WHEN** the user closes a running call and it then reaches `completed`
- **THEN** it stays collapsed

#### Scenario: An untouched call follows the default

- **WHEN** a call the user has never toggled reaches `completed`
- **THEN** it collapses

### Requirement: Collapse state is per call and not persisted

The open/closed state SHALL be tracked per tool call, so opening one leaves
the others as they were, and SHALL NOT be persisted: a reloaded conversation
starts from the automatic behaviour again.

#### Scenario: Opening one call leaves the others alone

- **WHEN** the user opens one of several collapsed calls
- **THEN** only that one expands

#### Scenario: A reloaded conversation starts fresh

- **WHEN** a session is restarted or its conversation reloaded
- **THEN** every finished call renders collapsed again, whatever the user had
  opened before

### Requirement: Collapsing does not move what the user is reading

A call collapsing on completion SHALL NOT scroll the conversation away from
what the user is looking at. While auto-scroll is following a response, the
panel SHALL stay at the end of the conversation; while it is not, the content
the user is reading SHALL stay where it is.

#### Scenario: A call finishes while the user reads earlier output

- **WHEN** the user has scrolled back to read earlier output and a call
  further down completes and collapses
- **THEN** what the user is reading stays in place

#### Scenario: A call finishes while auto-scroll is following

- **WHEN** auto-scroll is following a streaming response and a call above it
  collapses
- **THEN** the panel stays at the end of the conversation

### Requirement: Conversation rendering is virtualized

The conversation in the panel SHALL render through a virtualized list
scroller that lays out, measures and paints only the rows near the viewport
(plus a small overdraw margin), never the whole history. The per-frame work
and the retained layout state SHALL therefore be bounded by how much of the
conversation fits on screen, not by the conversation's total length, so a
long session does not get measurably more expensive the longer it runs.

Messages that have scrolled out of the viewport SHALL NOT be destroyed; they
are skipped for that frame's layout and painting only, so their full content
is still reachable by scrolling. Materializing a row later SHALL yield the
same content and state it would have had if the whole conversation had been
built eagerly.

#### Scenario: A long conversation stays cheap to render

- **WHEN** a conversation contains far more messages than can fit on screen at
  once
- **THEN** the panel lays out and paints only the messages near the viewport,
  and remains fluent as the user scrolls, regardless of how long the
  conversation is

#### Scenario: A previously skipped message still has its content

- **WHEN** the user scrolls to a message that is not currently materialized
- **THEN** that message renders with the full content and state it would have
  had if the whole conversation had been built eagerly

### Requirement: Streaming keeps the visible message anchored

As a message streams and grows, the row it belongs to SHALL be re-measured and
updated in place, without re-laying-out or tearing down the rest of the
conversation, so the content the user is currently reading does not jump. When
the user is following the tail, the panel SHALL stay at the end of the
conversation so newly streamed output remains visible as it arrives.

#### Scenario: Streaming output while reading earlier history

- **WHEN** the user has scrolled away from the tail and a visible message
  gains more streamed text
- **THEN** the growing row is re-measured in place and what the user is
  reading stays where it is

#### Scenario: Streaming output while following the tail

- **WHEN** the panel is following the tail and a new message begins to stream
- **THEN** the panel stays at the end of the conversation and the new content
  appears as it streams

### Requirement: Per-message and jump controls reach any message

The panel's scroll controls (scroll to the originating user message, scroll to
top, and jump to latest) SHALL operate on the virtualized list and SHALL reach
any message even if it is not currently materialized.

#### Scenario: Scroll to an unmaterialized user message

- **WHEN** the user activates "scroll to user input" for a response whose user
  message lies far above the current viewport
- **THEN** the panel scrolls that user message into view

#### Scenario: Jump to latest resumes tail following

- **WHEN** the user activates the jump-to-latest control after scrolling the
  history away from the tail
- **THEN** the panel scrolls to the newest message and resumes following
  streamed output

#### Scenario: Scroll to top from anywhere

- **WHEN** the user activates the scroll-to-top control
- **THEN** the panel shows the earliest message regardless of how far it is
  from the viewport

### Requirement: Collapsed tool call header is a single line

A collapsed tool call SHALL render its header on a single line: the title
SHALL truncate with an ellipsis when it does not fit rather than wrap, and
the status indicator SHALL remain visible on that same line. An expanded tool
call SHALL NOT be affected.

A title containing line breaks SHALL still render as one line. The header SHALL
join it - each run of whitespace read as a single space - and then truncate it
to the header's width, so a multi-line shell command reads as the beginning of
that command rather than as every line of it. Declaring the line unwrappable is
not sufficient: text is shaped one line per line break whether wrapping is
permitted or not.

The joined line SHALL keep the title's leading content: what identifies a call
is how its command starts, so truncation takes from the end.

#### Scenario: A long title ellipsizes when collapsed

- **WHEN** a collapsed tool call's title is longer than the header's width
- **THEN** the header is one line tall and the title ends in an ellipsis

#### Scenario: The indicator stays on the line

- **WHEN** a collapsed tool call's title is ellipsized
- **THEN** the status indicator remains visible at the row's end rather than
  being pushed off or wrapped

#### Scenario: Expanded cards are unchanged

- **WHEN** the user expands a tool call whose title is long
- **THEN** the header behaves as it does today and the title is free to wrap

#### Scenario: A multi-line command collapses to one line

- **WHEN** a collapsed tool call's title is a shell command spanning several
  lines, such as a heredoc
- **THEN** the header is one line tall, reading the start of that command with
  its line breaks shown as spaces and ending in an ellipsis

#### Scenario: An expanded card keeps the agent's own line breaks

- **WHEN** the user expands a tool call whose title spans several lines
- **THEN** the title is shown as the agent sent it, its line breaks intact

#### Scenario: A short multi-line title needs no ellipsis

- **WHEN** a collapsed tool call's title has a line break but is short enough
  to fit once joined
- **THEN** the header is one line tall, shows the whole title, and carries no
  ellipsis

### Requirement: A row that declares one line renders one line

Wherever the panel renders text on a single line - a collapsed tool call's
title, a queued prompt's row - it SHALL render one line regardless of what the
text contains, including text the user or the agent supplied with line breaks in
it.

Such a row SHALL NOT grow to the height of its text. A queued multi-line prompt
is a row in a list of what is waiting, and a row whose height is set by its
content displaces the conversation around it.

The text itself SHALL NOT be altered: joining line breaks is how the row is
drawn, and what is stored, delivered to the agent, or shown when the same text
is rendered somewhere that permits multiple lines SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: A queued multi-line prompt occupies one row

- **WHEN** the user enqueues a prompt written across several lines
- **THEN** its queued row is one line tall, its line breaks shown as spaces and
  its text ellipsized if it does not fit

#### Scenario: The delivered prompt is not the flattened one

- **WHEN** that queued prompt is delivered to the agent
- **THEN** the agent receives the prompt as the user wrote it, line breaks
  included

#### Scenario: The conversation shows the prompt in full

- **WHEN** that prompt has been delivered and appears as a message in the
  conversation
- **THEN** it is shown as written, across as many lines as it needs

### Requirement: Input area context indicator
The input area SHALL display a radial indicator in its bottom bar when the ACP
session reports a positive context-window size. Its fill SHALL represent used
context tokens as a fraction of the reported total; its remainder SHALL
represent available context. Its tooltip SHALL state the used and total token
counts. The indicator SHALL be absent until the agent reports usable values.

#### Scenario: A usage update fills the indicator
- **WHEN** an ACP session reports 53,000 used tokens from a 200,000-token
  context window
- **THEN** the radial indicator is filled to 26.5 percent and its tooltip
  identifies both values

#### Scenario: No usage update is available
- **WHEN** the ACP agent does not report context-window usage
- **THEN** the bottom bar does not show a context indicator

### Requirement: Retry uses the icon-button convention

The retry action SHALL render as an icon button rather than a text button. The icon SHALL have a localized accessible label and tooltip describing retry, and activating it SHALL preserve the existing retry behavior.

#### Scenario: Retry renders as an icon
- **WHEN** a response exposes a retry action
- **THEN** the action is shown as an icon button with no visible text label

#### Scenario: Retry tooltip identifies the action
- **WHEN** the user points to or focuses the retry icon
- **THEN** a localized tooltip and accessible label identify it as retry

#### Scenario: Retry behavior is unchanged
- **WHEN** the user activates the retry icon
- **THEN** the same message is retried using the existing retry flow

### Requirement: Panel chrome adopts the macOS system palette

On macOS, the panel's chrome SHALL follow the platform's system colors: the
user prompt bubble and primary controls tinted by the system accent color
(`controlAccentColor`), the prompt's foreground contrasting the resolved
accent, focused controls bordered/tinted by that accent, and neutral surfaces
(bubbles, cards, inputs, separators, window background) taken from the
system's dynamic neutrals so they track the current appearance. Non-macOS
platforms SHALL render the fixed palette they render today.
Semantic state colors (agent status indicators, risk tinting, danger) SHALL
NOT be replaced by system colors.

#### Scenario: The prompt bubble follows the user's accent color
- **WHEN** the system accent color is changed on macOS
- **THEN** the user prompt bubble and primary buttons render in that accent,
  and the prompt text remains readable against it

#### Scenario: The prompt stays readable in light mode
- **WHEN** the panel is in light appearance with an accent whose luminance
  makes white text unreadable
- **THEN** the prompt foreground switches to a dark contrast color

#### Scenario: Focus paints with the system accent
- **WHEN** an input or button receives focus on macOS
- **THEN** its border and focus tint use the system accent, not a fixed
  application blue

#### Scenario: An appearance flip repaints live
- **WHEN** the macOS appearance changes from light to dark (or back)
- **THEN** the panel's neutral surfaces re-resolve and repaint without
  requiring a settings change or restart

#### Scenario: State colors stay fixed
- **WHEN** a tool call or agent renders a semantic state color (idle,
  running, error, safe, danger)
- **THEN** that color is the application's fixed state palette, unchanged by
  the system accent or appearance

#### Scenario: Non-macOS platforms are unchanged
- **WHEN** the app runs on Linux or Windows
- **THEN** the panel renders with the existing fixed palette

### Requirement: Model dropdown scrolls

When the models a selected agent declares exceed the height available to
the model selector's dropdown, the dropdown SHALL be vertically scrollable,
so every declared model remains reachable by scrolling, with no other action
required. When the declared models fit within the available height, the
dropdown SHALL show all of them without scrolling.

The Swift reference has no equivalent dropdown to keep parity with: the
model axis is offered from the agent's own declared Session Config Options,
which the port introduces. This requirement is intended port behavior.

#### Scenario: More models than fit scroll

- **WHEN** the agent declares more models than the open model dropdown can
  display at once
- **THEN** the user can scroll the dropdown, and every model below the fold
  becomes selectable by scrolling to it

#### Scenario: Models that fit need no scroll

- **WHEN** the agent declares at most as many models as the dropdown can
  display at once
- **THEN** every declared model is visible in the open dropdown without
  scrolling

#### Scenario: The last declared model is reachable

- **WHEN** the agent declares more models than the dropdown can display and
  the user scrolls the list to its end
- **THEN** the last declared model is visible and selectable

### Requirement: Model dropdown searches

The model selector's dropdown SHALL provide a search field that filters the
listed models by case-insensitive substring match on the model's displayed
name, so a model can be found by typing part of its name. While the search
field is non-empty, only models matching it SHALL be listed; a model that
does not match SHALL NOT be offered. Clearing the field SHALL restore the
full list.

#### Scenario: Typing narrows the list

- **WHEN** the user types text into the model dropdown's search field
- **THEN** only models whose displayed name contains that text (case-
  insensitive) are listed

#### Scenario: Empty search shows everything

- **WHEN** the search field is empty
- **THEN** every declared model is listed, in the agent's declared order

#### Scenario: No match selects nothing

- **WHEN** no declared model matches the search text
- **THEN** the dropdown offers no model to select, and the currently
  selected model is left unchanged until the user empties or changes the
  search text

### Requirement: A loaded conversation shows its history
When a Panel-mode agent's session is loaded rather than created - a restart
that keeps the conversation, or a layout restore - the panel SHALL show the
conversation the agent replays, with each of the user's prompts as its own
user message and each reply as its own assistant message, in the order
replayed. Consecutive chunks of one prompt SHALL join into one message.

The loaded conversation SHALL open scrolled to its newest message, not its
first: a reader coming back to it wants where it left off.

A replayed prompt SHALL NOT start a turn: it was answered long ago, and the
composer stays usable. A user message chunk that arrives while a turn is in
flight SHALL be ignored, because the panel has already recorded the prompt it
sent, and showing an echo would duplicate it.

#### Scenario: Restarting keeps the visible conversation
- **WHEN** an agent whose conversation holds two prompts and two replies is
  restarted keeping its conversation
- **THEN** the panel shows the two prompts and the two replies, alternating,
  rather than the replies run together with no prompts

#### Scenario: A long loaded conversation opens at its end
- **WHEN** an agent with a conversation longer than its panel is restarted
  keeping it
- **THEN** the panel shows the newest message, with the earlier ones above it

#### Scenario: An echoed prompt is not doubled
- **WHEN** the user sends a prompt and the agent echoes it as a user message
  chunk during the turn
- **THEN** the prompt appears once

### Requirement: Harness-injected messages are not shown as the user's

A replayed user message chunk that the agent's harness injected, rather than
the user typing it, SHALL NOT be shown as a user message.

A chunk is injected when its `_meta["_claude/origin"].kind` is present and is
anything other than `human` or `channel`. When no origin is present, a chunk
is injected only if it consists entirely of one or more
`<task-notification>…</task-notification>` or
`<system-reminder>…</system-reminder>` blocks, with nothing but whitespace
between and around them. An origin, when present, decides in both directions:
a `human` or `channel` origin keeps a chunk the user's, whatever its text.

An injected chunk SHALL be shown as follows:

- A chunk holding a task notification SHALL become a compact notice row. Its
  text is "Background task finished: <summary>", using the notification's
  `<summary>` with its whitespace collapsed, or "Background task finished"
  when it has none.
- A chunk of `<system-reminder>` blocks only SHALL NOT be shown. The reminders
  are written for the model, and the live stream never shows them either.
- An origin-tagged chunk that is neither SHALL become a notice row reading
  "Automated message". The event is noted, but text written for the model is
  not shown as though someone had said it.

A notice row SHALL be a single line, smaller than a message and muted, and
SHALL be visually distinct from user, assistant, tool-call and error entries.
Its text SHALL come from localization.

An injected chunk SHALL NOT join the user message before it. This matters
because Claude Code appends reminders to a prompt as their own block, and the
prompt has to stay as the user typed it.

The same rule for when chunks are ignored as for the user's own prompts
applies: while a turn is in flight, a user message chunk is ignored.

This diverges from what `claude-agent-acp` does. Live, it drops these
messages; on replay, it sends them as the user's with no origin tag.

#### Scenario: A background task finished between turns

- **WHEN** a conversation that contains a `<task-notification>` user message
  with the summary "Tests passed" is replayed
- **THEN** no user message is shown for it, and a notice row reading
  "Background task finished: Tests passed" is shown where it was

#### Scenario: A prompt that mentions the tag

- **WHEN** a replayed user message reads `what is a <task-notification>?`
- **THEN** it is shown as the user's message

#### Scenario: A reminder appended to a prompt

- **WHEN** a replayed prompt arrives as a chunk of the user's text followed by
  a chunk that is only a `<system-reminder>` block
- **THEN** the prompt is shown as the user typed it, and the reminder is not
  shown

#### Scenario: The adapter tags the origin

- **WHEN** a replayed user chunk carries `_claude/origin` kind
  `task-notification`
- **THEN** it is not shown as the user's message, whatever its text

#### Scenario: A human origin wins over the text

- **WHEN** a replayed user chunk carries `_claude/origin` kind `human` and its
  text is a `<task-notification>` block
- **THEN** it is shown as the user's message

### Requirement: Message timestamps are shown only while ⌘ is held
A prompt's or response's timestamp label SHALL be hidden by default and SHALL
appear only while the ⌘ key is held and the panel's window is key, matching
the sidebar's existing key-hint disclosure. A hidden timestamp SHALL NOT
reserve layout space.

#### Scenario: Timestamps hidden by default
- **WHEN** a conversation is showing and no modifier key is held
- **THEN** no prompt or response in the panel shows a timestamp label

#### Scenario: Holding ⌘ reveals timestamps after a short delay
- **WHEN** the user holds ⌘ while the panel's window is key, for at least
  the sidebar key-hint delay
- **THEN** every visible prompt and response shows its relative timestamp,
  each with a tooltip giving the absolute time in the user's local time zone

#### Scenario: Releasing ⌘ hides timestamps immediately
- **WHEN** timestamps are shown because ⌘ is held
- **AND** the user releases ⌘
- **THEN** every timestamp label disappears immediately

#### Scenario: A keypress during the hold cancels it
- **WHEN** ⌘ is held and timestamps are showing or pending
- **AND** any other key is pressed
- **THEN** the hold ends and timestamps hide, matching the sidebar key-hint
  behavior for an in-progress shortcut

#### Scenario: Losing key window status ends the hold
- **WHEN** the panel's window stops being the active key window while ⌘ is
  held
- **THEN** the hold ends and timestamps hide, since macOS does not deliver
  the ⌘ key-up to a window that lost key status
