## Purpose

Defines the settings window in the `knot` app: what it shows, how each
control maps to a `Settings` scalar, and how edits are persisted.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Settings window is reachable from the app menu

The system SHALL expose a "Settings…" item in the app menu, bound to the
platform-standard shortcut (`Cmd+,`), that opens a single General settings
window. Activating the item while the window is already open SHALL bring
the existing window forward rather than opening a second one.

#### Scenario: Opening settings from the menu

- **WHEN** the user selects "Settings…" from the app menu
- **THEN** a settings window opens showing the General pane

#### Scenario: Reactivating an open settings window

- **WHEN** the settings window is already open and the user selects
  "Settings…" again
- **THEN** the existing window is raised and focused; no second window opens

### Requirement: Appearance control

The window SHALL show an "Appearance" section with a picker bound to
`appearance_mode`, offering Auto, System, Light, and Dark. Changing the
selection SHALL persist the new value immediately and SHALL apply it
immediately — see `appearance-mode` for what each value resolves to and what
"apply" repaints. A persisted selection that changes nothing on screen is not
a satisfied requirement.

The section's hint SHALL describe what the control does in this app. It SHALL
NOT describe deriving the scheme from a terminal background colour, which the
port has no setting for.

#### Scenario: Changing appearance mode persists

- **WHEN** the user picks "Dark" in the Appearance picker
- **THEN** `appearance_mode` is saved as `"dark"` before the picker closes

#### Scenario: Changing appearance mode repaints

- **WHEN** the user picks "Dark" in the Appearance picker
- **THEN** the settings window and every other open window paint dark, with no
  relaunch

### Requirement: Startup controls

The window SHALL show a "Startup" section with:

- A "Restore agents on launch" toggle bound to `restore_layout_on_launch`.
- A "Restore last conversation" toggle bound to
  `restore_conversation_on_launch`, enabled only when
  `restore_layout_on_launch` is on (it has no effect otherwise) and
  disabled — not hidden — when it is off, so the setting's existence stays
  visible.
- A "Keep running in menu bar when closed" toggle bound to
  `keep_in_menu_bar`.

Each toggle SHALL persist its new value immediately on change.

#### Scenario: Restore-conversation toggle disabled when layout restore is off

- **WHEN** `restore_layout_on_launch` is off
- **THEN** the "Restore last conversation" toggle is shown disabled,
  reflecting its stored value but not accepting input

#### Scenario: Turning off layout restore does not clear conversation restore

- **WHEN** `restore_conversation_on_launch` is on and the user turns off
  "Restore agents on launch"
- **THEN** `restore_conversation_on_launch`'s stored value is unchanged, and
  its toggle becomes disabled

#### Scenario: Toggling a startup switch persists

- **WHEN** the user turns on "Keep running in menu bar when closed"
- **THEN** `keep_in_menu_bar` is saved as `true` immediately

### Requirement: Notifications control

The window SHALL show a "Notifications" section with a "Desktop
notifications" toggle bound to `desktop_notifications_enabled`, persisting
immediately on change.

#### Scenario: Toggling desktop notifications persists

- **WHEN** the user turns off "Desktop notifications"
- **THEN** `desktop_notifications_enabled` is saved as `false` immediately

### Requirement: Window scope

The settings window SHALL show a tab strip with seven tabs — General,
Coding, Autopilot, Voice, MCP, Appearance, Keyboard — in that order, with
General selected by default when the window opens. Every tab SHALL render
its real pane; none render a placeholder. No "check for updates" control
SHALL be shown anywhere in the window.

Personas, Prompts and Bench are not tabs. Each has a window of its own (see
`library-windows`).

The Keyboard tab's contents are specified by `keybindings`. The Swift reference
has no Keyboard tab.

#### Scenario: General is the default tab

- **WHEN** the settings window opens
- **THEN** the General tab is selected and its four sections (Appearance,
  Startup, Notifications, Agent Panel) are visible

#### Scenario: Keyboard is the last tab

- **WHEN** the settings window opens
- **THEN** Keyboard is the seventh tab, after Appearance

#### Scenario: The libraries are not tabs

- **WHEN** the settings window opens
- **THEN** its tab strip has no Personas, Prompts or Bench tab

### Requirement: Agent Panel control

The General tab SHALL show an "Agent Panel" section with a "Shift+Enter to
send" toggle bound to `agent_panel_shift_enter_sends`, persisting
immediately on change, and a hint stating what the off state does: Enter
sends the message and Shift+Enter adds a newline.

The hint is required rather than decorative. The toggle names one of the two
arrangements, and which key sends in the other is not recoverable from a
switch labelled with the first.

#### Scenario: Toggling Shift+Enter to send persists

- **WHEN** the user turns on "Shift+Enter to send"
- **THEN** `agent_panel_shift_enter_sends` is saved as `true` immediately

#### Scenario: The section explains the off state

- **WHEN** the General tab is open
- **THEN** the Agent Panel section states that with the toggle off, Enter
  sends the message and Shift+Enter adds a newline

### Requirement: Coding tab

The Coding tab SHALL show a "Source Folder" section (current
`source_base_folder`, a folder picker, and a clear action) and an "Agent
Options" section (an agent-type picker with a per-type options field bound
to `agent_options`). The agent-type picker SHALL offer Claude, Codex,
OpenCode, Gemini, Copilot and Shell. It SHALL NOT show an "Open With"
section or editable custom-command fields — those depend on features not yet
in the Rust port.

The clear action SHALL ask for confirmation before clearing. Unlike every
other control on this tab, it discards a path the user chose through a file
dialog and cannot retype from memory.

#### Scenario: Choosing a source folder persists it

- **WHEN** the user picks a directory via "Choose…" in the Source Folder
  section
- **THEN** `source_base_folder` is saved as that directory's path
  immediately

#### Scenario: Clearing the source folder

- **WHEN** the user clicks the clear action next to a configured source
  folder and confirms the prompt
- **THEN** `source_base_folder` is saved as an empty string

#### Scenario: Cancelling the clear

- **WHEN** the user clicks the clear action and dismisses the prompt without
  confirming
- **THEN** `source_base_folder` is unchanged

#### Scenario: Editing options for an agent type persists it

- **WHEN** the user selects "Codex" in the agent-type picker and types
  `--flag value` into the Options field
- **THEN** `agent_options["codex"]` is saved as `"--flag value"`
  immediately

#### Scenario: Switching agent type shows that type's own options

- **WHEN** `agent_options["claude"]` is `"--foo"` and the user switches the
  picker from Claude to Codex (with no stored value yet)
- **THEN** the Options field shows empty, not `"--foo"`

### Requirement: Autopilot tab

The Autopilot tab SHALL show: an "Enable autopilot" toggle bound to
`autopilot_enabled`; an AI Provider section with a provider picker
(OpenAI/Anthropic/Google) bound to `ai_provider`, an API key text field
bound to `ai_api_key`, and a read-only model-name display derived from the
selected provider; and an Action section with a picker (Mark
conversation/Ask me/Auto-continue/Custom) bound to `autopilot_action`, plus
a custom-prompt text area bound to `autopilot_custom_prompt` shown only
when "Custom" is selected. Every control persists on change. The tab SHALL
NOT claim or imply the feature is functional beyond storing these
preferences - no decision loop runs as a result of this change.

#### Scenario: Enabling autopilot persists

- **WHEN** the user turns on "Enable autopilot"
- **THEN** `autopilot_enabled` is saved as `true` immediately

#### Scenario: Changing provider persists and updates the model display

- **WHEN** the user selects "Anthropic" in the provider picker
- **THEN** `ai_provider` is saved as `"anthropic"` and the model display
  updates to the Anthropic model name

#### Scenario: API key field persists

- **WHEN** the user types a value into the API Key field
- **THEN** `ai_api_key` is saved with that exact value immediately

#### Scenario: Custom prompt only shown for the Custom action

- **WHEN** `autopilot_action` is not `"custom"`
- **THEN** the custom-prompt text area is not shown

#### Scenario: Selecting Custom reveals the prompt editor

- **WHEN** the user selects "Custom" in the action picker
- **THEN** the custom-prompt text area appears, bound to
  `autopilot_custom_prompt`, persisting on edit

### Requirement: Voice tab

The Voice tab SHALL show: an "Enable voice input" toggle bound to
`voice_enabled`; an engine picker showing "Apple SpeechAnalyzer" as the
only, disabled option (reflecting `voice_engine` always being `"apple"`);
a read-only display of the key name for `voice_push_to_talk_key`; and an
"Auto-insert transcription" toggle bound to `voice_auto_insert`. The
push-to-talk key display SHALL NOT be interactively changeable from this
tab. Every persistable control SHALL be disabled when `voice_enabled` is
false, matching the Swift reference's dependent-control disabling.

#### Scenario: Enabling voice input persists

- **WHEN** the user turns on "Enable voice input"
- **THEN** `voice_enabled` is saved as `true` immediately

#### Scenario: Dependent controls disabled while voice is off

- **WHEN** `voice_enabled` is false
- **THEN** the push-to-talk key display and "Auto-insert transcription"
  toggle are shown disabled

#### Scenario: Auto-insert toggle persists

- **WHEN** voice input is enabled and the user turns off "Auto-insert
  transcription"
- **THEN** `voice_auto_insert` is saved as `false` immediately

#### Scenario: Push-to-talk key is read-only

- **WHEN** the Voice tab is open
- **THEN** the configured key's name is shown as static text, with no
  control to record or change it

### Requirement: MCP tab

The MCP tab SHALL show an "Enable MCP server" toggle bound to
`mcp_server_enabled`, a port field bound to `mcp_server_port`, a read-only
server URL derived from the current port with a copy action of its own, and
an installation-command generator (agent-type picker + the exact command for
that type + copy action), each persisting on change. The installation
command's agent-type picker SHALL offer Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini and
Copilot — not Shell, which runs no MCP client to register.

The URL SHALL be the MCP endpoint an agent connects to, not the server's
root: it carries the `/mcp` path, and a URL without it is one an agent
cannot use.

#### Scenario: Toggling the MCP server persists

- **WHEN** the user turns off "Enable MCP server"
- **THEN** `mcp_server_enabled` is saved as `false` immediately

#### Scenario: Changing the port persists and updates the URL

- **WHEN** the user sets the port field to `9000`
- **THEN** `mcp_server_port` is saved as `9000` and the displayed URL
  updates to reflect port `9000`, keeping its `/mcp` path

#### Scenario: Copying the server URL

- **WHEN** the user clicks the copy action beside the URL
- **THEN** the system clipboard receives exactly the displayed URL,
  including its `/mcp` path

#### Scenario: Installation command matches the selected agent type

- **WHEN** the user selects "Codex" in the agent-type picker
- **THEN** the displayed command is the Codex-specific registration
  command containing the current server URL

#### Scenario: Copy action copies the exact displayed command

- **WHEN** the user clicks the copy action
- **THEN** the system clipboard receives exactly the currently-displayed
  command text

### Requirement: Appearance tab

The Appearance tab SHALL show a "Fonts" section with one row per
configurable font — UI, Title and Terminal — bound to `ui_font_name` /
`ui_font_size`, `title_font_name` / `title_font_size`, and
`terminal_font_name` / `terminal_font_size` respectively.

Each row SHALL govern the text its label names:

- The UI row SHALL govern the application's default family and text size — the
  face the interface and all body text is drawn in, including Markdown body
  text.
- The Title row SHALL govern titles and headers, including Markdown headers.
- The Terminal row SHALL govern embedded terminal text only.

A row SHALL NOT be bound to a setting that governs other text than the row's
label names. A user changing the font the app is written in looks under UI, and
a row that renamed itself to whatever field it happened to write would send
them to the wrong one.

Each row SHALL offer a single control naming the current family and size,
which opens the OS font panel pre-selected to that family and size. One
control picks both, because the panel carries its own size field; the tab
SHALL NOT show a separate numeric size field. A choice made in the panel
SHALL persist immediately.

The tab SHALL NOT show a terminal engine picker or color pickers.

#### Scenario: Changing the font name persists

- **WHEN** the user picks "JetBrains Mono" in the font panel opened from the
  Terminal row
- **THEN** `terminal_font_name` is saved as `"JetBrains Mono"` immediately

#### Scenario: Changing the font size persists

- **WHEN** the user sets the size to `14` in the font panel opened from the
  Terminal row
- **THEN** `terminal_font_size` is saved as `14.0` immediately

#### Scenario: Each row drives its own font

- **WHEN** the user picks a family in the font panel opened from the UI row
- **THEN** `ui_font_name` is saved and `title_font_name` and
  `terminal_font_name` are unchanged

#### Scenario: The UI row changes the face the interface is drawn in

- **WHEN** the user picks a family in the font panel opened from the UI row
- **THEN** the interface's own text — window chrome, labels, buttons, dialogs,
  and Markdown body text — is drawn in that family

#### Scenario: The Title row changes headers rather than the interface

- **WHEN** the user picks a family in the font panel opened from the Title row
- **THEN** titles and headers are drawn in that family and the rest of the
  interface is unchanged

### Requirement: A font picker renders in the font it names

Each row's control in the Appearance tab's Fonts section SHALL render its
label in the family that label names, so the section shows three faces rather
than three strings in the same face.

The label SHALL keep its existing text - the family name and the size in
points - and SHALL render at the settings window's own text size, not at the
configured point size. The point size is already stated as a number; drawing
the label at it would let one row's setting change every row's height.

#### Scenario: A row shows its own face

- **WHEN** the UI font is set to one family and the Terminal font to another
- **THEN** each row's label is drawn in its own family, and the two differ

#### Scenario: Picking a font updates the face immediately

- **WHEN** the user picks a new family in the font panel opened from a row
- **THEN** that row's label is redrawn in the newly chosen family, without
  reopening the settings window

#### Scenario: The point size does not change the label's size

- **WHEN** the Title font's size is set to 48
- **THEN** the Title row's label reads "48pt" and is drawn at the same text
  size as the UI and Terminal rows, leaving all three rows the same height

### Requirement: An unresolvable font is marked rather than substituted

A persisted family that the text system cannot resolve - one uninstalled
since it was chosen, or one the OS font panel accepts that the app's own font
lookup does not - SHALL be shown in the default face and marked as
unavailable, in the row itself, so the mismatch between the name and the face
is stated rather than left for the user to notice.

The row SHALL go on naming the persisted family rather than the substitute.
What the user needs is to see that their choice is not in effect; renaming the
row to the fallback would hide exactly that.

The persisted value SHALL NOT be rewritten. A font that is missing today may
be installed tomorrow, and silently replacing the setting would lose a choice
the user made deliberately.

#### Scenario: A font that is not installed

- **WHEN** the UI font is set to a family that is not installed
- **THEN** the UI row still names that family, is drawn in the default face,
  and is marked as unavailable
- **AND** `ui_font_name` still holds that family

#### Scenario: A resolvable font is not marked

- **WHEN** every configured family resolves
- **THEN** no row carries the unavailable marking

#### Scenario: Installing the font clears the marking

- **WHEN** a row is marked unavailable and the named family becomes
  resolvable
- **THEN** the marking goes and the row renders in that family, with no
  change to the persisted value

### Requirement: Tab switching preserves window state

Switching tabs SHALL NOT close the settings window or discard any pane's
in-progress, unsaved state (e.g. a persona editor's draft fields). Returning
to a previously-visited tab SHALL show it exactly as it was left.

#### Scenario: Switching away and back preserves a draft

- **WHEN** the user has unsaved text in one pane's editable field and
  switches to another tab, then back
- **THEN** the unsaved text is still present, unchanged
