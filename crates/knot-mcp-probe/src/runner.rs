//! Running an agent's own MCP list command, behind a trait so the rest of
//! the crate is testable without any agent CLI installed.
//!
//! The command runs **in the agent's own working directory and environment**,
//! not Knot's. Project-scoped configuration resolves relative to the working
//! directory, and variables like `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` decide which user
//! configuration is in play, so a probe run from Knot's own cwd would
//! silently answer a different question than the one the user is looking at.
//!
//! Stdin is closed. A CLI that would prompt then fails immediately instead of
//! sitting there until [`PROBE_TIMEOUT`] - the difference between a clear
//! failure and a section that says "checking" for thirty seconds.
