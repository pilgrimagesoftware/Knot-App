//! Durable configuration store: scalar settings plus the serialized
//! collections (saved agents, workspaces, personas, bench templates, library
//! prompts, recent repos, recorded pull requests), with decode-tolerant
//! migration, first-launch source-folder detection, and a bounded recent-repos
//! MRU.
//!
//! Contract: `openspec/specs/settings-persistence/spec.md`.
//!
//! One [`Settings`] value is one settings surface over nine documents, whose
//! locations [`StorePaths`] derives:
//!
//! | Document | Holds | Directory |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `preferences.json` | every scalar setting | user preferences |
//! | `agents.json` | saved agents | application data |
//! | `workspaces.json` | saved workspaces | application data |
//! | `workspace-ui-state.json` | per-workspace UI state | application data |
//! | `personas.json` | personas | application data |
//! | `bench.json` | bench templates | application data |
//! | `prompts.json` | library prompts | application data |
//! | `recent-repos.json` | recent repositories | application data |
//! | `pull-requests.json` | recorded pull requests | application data |
//!
//! Three kinds, distinguished by what the values are rather than by which
//! screen edits them: the scalars the user tunes, the collections the user
//! built, and - in `workspace-ui-state.json` - what the application recorded
//! about how its own windows were arranged, which the user never entered.
//! That last one is separate so that moving a window, the most frequent write
//! in the store and the least valuable, does not rewrite the roster.
//!
//! Every mutating helper writes immediately, and writes only the document it
//! changed: [`Settings::persist`] is the whole surface, while
//! [`Settings::persist_preferences`] and the per-collection writers are what
//! the helpers actually call. Each document loads on its own, so one that
//! fails to decode costs only what it held and the app still starts.
//!
//! Two one-way migrations run on load, and compose: an installation still
//! holding the single `settings.json` is migrated off it - see [`legacy`] -
//! and a `workspaces.json` whose records still carry UI state is split - see
//! [`workspace_split`]. The legacy migration's own output is combined, so the
//! split runs on its result as well as on a pre-existing document.
//!
//! Two upgrades run on the preferences document. The terminal font's
//! `"SF Mono"` default is replaced value-for-value, and a document written
//! before the two proportional fonts swapped roles has them exchanged once,
//! gated on the `settingsVersion` marker - see [`migrate_font_roles`].
