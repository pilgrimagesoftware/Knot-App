//! Where each settings document lives.
//!
//! Contract: `openspec/specs/settings-persistence/spec.md`.
//!
//! The store is three kinds of document in two directories: the preferences
//! document in the platform's user-preferences directory, and - in the
//! application-data directory - one document per durable collection plus the
//! per-workspace UI-state document. The third kind is distinguished by what
//! its values are, not by where it lives: UI state is what the application
//! recorded about its own windows, which the user never entered.
//! [`StorePaths`] holds the two locations and derives every document's path
//! from them, so nothing else has to know a filename.
