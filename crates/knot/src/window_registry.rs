//! Which window is open for what, so a second request to open something
//! raises the window that already exists instead of making another.
//!
//! Three windows - About, Settings, Import - each solved this for themselves
//! with an `Rc<RefCell<Option<AnyWindowHandle>>>` captured by the closure that
//! registers their action. That works for a window there is only ever one of.
//! A workspace window needs a map rather than a slot, and the routes that open
//! one (`workspace_manager`, `command_center`, the agent editor's post-create
//! jump) belong to no single owner that could hold it, so the map lives here as
//! a global.
//!
//! Liveness is asked by updating the handle: a closed window fails its update.
//! That is the same test the three existing singletons use, and it is why no
//! close observer is needed - a stale entry is noticed and dropped on the next
//! request for its key.
//!
//! Contract: `openspec/specs/window-lifecycle/spec.md`.
