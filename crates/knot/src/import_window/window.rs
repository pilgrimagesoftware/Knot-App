//! The Import window's state and lifecycle: what it scanned, what the user
//! ticked, what the last import did, and how the window opens.
//!
//! Contract: `openspec/specs/import-ui/spec.md`, over
//! `openspec/specs/data-import/spec.md`.
//!
//! An import is something the user runs, not something they configure, so it
//! is a window of its own reached from File rather than a settings tab. A
//! single instance, like About and Settings - choosing Import again raises
//! the one that is open.
//!
//! Rendering lives in [`super::pane`]; this file holds only state and the
//! actions that change it.
