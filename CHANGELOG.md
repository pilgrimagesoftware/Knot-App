## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-04

**Personas** — Give your agents personality. Assign a persona when creating an agent to influence its coding style and philosophy. Want a TDD purist? Pick Kent Beck. Need raw performance focus? Go with John Carmack. Knot ships with 6 built-in personas from legendary engineering minds, and you can create your own. Agents can also attach personas when they create new agents via MCP. Personas work with any agent that supports system prompts (Claude, Codex).

**Bench** — Save your favorite agent configurations and deploy them instantly. Right-click any agent to add it to the bench, then drag it into any workspace to spin up a pre-configured agent in seconds. Great for reusable setups you reach for often.
